## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Aletheia is a citizen effort's project that seeks to encourage both public and private entities to facilitate access to public information so that it can have a more relevant social impact.

As developers we have seen the need to make use of public information (information in the public domain that should be available and accessible by law) but in the search we quickly realized that although the information (in part) is available, it is not organized in a way that is easy to use (uses that can be from the consultation of the data, to the elaboration of the same for statistical use or to create computer products oriented to citizens. Another problem that we frequently find is the lack of a standard in the format of these files. As well as the use of formats that DO NOT allow the extraction of information. We know that, like us, there are other Dominicans who need access to this data and that is why we decided to develop a REST API to facilitate access and distribution The objective is to create an ecosystem where these files are ALWAYS available, accessible 24 hours a day, and accompanied by API for easy consumption and exchange of this information. In this way to obtain an immutable and reliable "single source of truth".

Aletheia has no affiliation with political, public or private entities. That is why we ask that if you believe in this project, please support us with a monetary contribution of any amount to keep this project in existence.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Aletheia Data will implement smart contracts which can be deployed into pallet of a parachain. For trading and liquidity purpose, Aletheia Data could be integrated with such protocols in Polkadot as Konomi and Zenlink.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target audience are developers who seek to access public information trought a public API.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

We provide an API to access public information for developer or citizen in the Dominican Republic. Our goverment seems not interested in providing that service.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

I don't think so. I couldn't find any.
